# Express Example
This is a simple Express Project that can be used as a guide to create your own Express Project.

This dummy project is a simple Weather API, that retrieves the weather data for certains ZipCode or city name. No sofisticated error treatment is used, every error is a INTERNAL SERVER ERROR.
